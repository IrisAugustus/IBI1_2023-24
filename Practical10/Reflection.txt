In this practical, I use python to create SIR models, gradually considering the vaccination population rate and spatial condition, from easy to hard.
Plainly creating a SIR model and plot it was simple, I just record the new values for SIR in every loop. However you need to pay attention to all the parameters you use in case you mistake them.
For SIR model with vaccination rate, you just need to add a kind of new population to consider, and create a new loop for percentage of vaccination.
For a SIR model considering spatial, there is many manipulations in numpy to create the 2D image. You can google the functions to use them.
The thing I enjoy most was to create loops in the code and then plotted them on the image. And I found it difficult to learn how to use new functions in python.
