From the formative assessment, I've made the following changes to my practical files.

E:\IBI1_2023-24\Practical6\average_day.py, I added an example, to print the time of the activity that the users command.

E:\IBI1_2023-24\Practical7\dalys.py, I change the rotation angle of the x ticks from -90 to -45, to make the user see them more clearly. Also, I change some of the unworking code to make it simpler. And I've change to an easier way to print the dalys of the Afghanistan.

E:\IBI1_2023-24\Practical8\count_repeat_duplicate_genes.py, I change the pattern to make the results accurate.

E:\IBI1_2023-24\Practical9, I make the output text line more accurate and grammarly correct, and I've added pseudocode.
