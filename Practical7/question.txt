Question:How has the DALYs changed in the UK over time? 
The answer in dalys.py starts at row 52

Discussion:
The data shows that the DALYs of UK decreased over time, and this agree with my expectation.
One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health. 
DALYs for a disease or health condition are the sum of the years of life lost 
to due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lived with a disability (YLDs) due to 
prevalent cases of the disease or health condition in a population.
If the people are healthier, the DALYs of the country will derease.
UK's economy and technology continued to develop these years.
The medical technology and medical security also gradually increased.
People become healthier, so the total number ofrepresents the loss of the 
equivalent of one year of full health decreased.
That is, UK's DALYs decreased.
